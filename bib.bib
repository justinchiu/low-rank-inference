Systems that can be modeled by hidden Markov models are a proper subclass of linearly dependent processes, a class of stochastic systems known from mathematical investigations carried out over the past four decades. This article provides a novel, simple characterization of linearly dependent processes, called observable operator models. The mathematical properties of observable operator models lead to a constructive learning algorithm for the identification of linearly dependent processes. The core of the algorithm has a time complexity of O (N + nm3), where N is the size of training data, n is the number of distinguishable outcomes of observations, and m is model state-space dimension. }

These HMMs, which we call anchor HMMs, assume that each tag is associated with at least one word that can have no other tag, which is a relatively benign condition for POS tagging (e.g., {``}the{''} is a word that appears only under the determiner tag). We exploit this assumption and extend the non-negative matrix factorization framework of Arora et al. (2013) to design a consistent estimator for anchor HMMs. In experiments, our algorithm is competitive with strong baselines such as the clustering method of Brown et al. (1992) and the log-linear model of Berg-Kirkpatrick et al. (2010). Furthermore, it produces an interpretable model in which hidden states are automatically lexicalized by words.",

    abstract = "Learning probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFGs) from strings is a classic problem in computational linguistics since Horning (1969). Here we present an algorithm based on distributional learning that is a consistent estimator for a large class of PCFGs that satisfy certain natural conditions including being anchored (Stratos et al., 2016). We proceed via a reparameterization of (top--down) PCFGs that we call a bottom{--}up weighted context-free grammar. We show that if the grammar is anchored and satisfies additional restrictions on its ambiguity, then the parameters can be directly related to distributional properties of the anchoring strings; we show the asymptotic correctness of a naive estimator and present some simulations using synthetic data that show that algorithms based on this approach have good finite sample behavior.",
